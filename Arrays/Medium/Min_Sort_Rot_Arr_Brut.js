// 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
// Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

// Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

// You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
// Example 3:

function findMinBrute(nums) {
  let min = nums[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] < min) {
      min = nums[i];
    }
  }
  return min;
}

console.log(findMinBrute([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])); // 1

// ⏱️ Time Complexity → O(n)

// You check every element.

// 💾 Space Complexity → O(1)

// Just a few variables.
